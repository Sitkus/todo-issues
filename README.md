# Simple Issues To-Do SAP

This project was built upon given task from a job interview.

Project goals were to build a simple single page application where users can enter their issues and mark them as complete / incomplete, update them using modal or mark as trashed. Project required to use router, redux (vuex) and if possible JEST or Mocha test units.

For test units I used JEST.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
